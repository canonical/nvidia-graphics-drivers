nvidia-graphics-drivers-535 (535.86.05-0ubuntu0.18.04.1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #2028125):
    - Fixed a bug that caused excessive memory consumption when
      OpenGL and Vulkan applications were running while VT-
      switched away from X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the kernel to panic when video
      memory is full.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented displays from refreshing when using
      an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)
      monitors to flicker by allowing the refresh rate to drop below
      the monitor's minimum.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption when running Vulkan
      applications.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a system hang when running
      windowed Vulkan applications with sync-to-vblank enabled.
    - Fixed a video memory leak observed when turning off a connected
      monitor while using certain Wayland compositors.
