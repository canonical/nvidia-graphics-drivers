nvidia-graphics-drivers-535 (535.146.02-0ubuntu0.23.10.1) mantic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #2045913):
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on
      suspend.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an
      application is run with __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1.
    - Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting
      applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via
      Wine.
    - Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual
      displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop
      layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a
      mix of physical and virtual displays.
    - Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend,
      which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some
      cases.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-535 (535.104.05-0ubuntu1) mantic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed an issue which caused the following error message to
      appear spuriously when using SLI with the NVIDIA  Open GPU
      Kernel Modules:
      (EE) NVIDIA: Unable to disable FB size compare
    - Fixed a bug which prevented DKMS from registering kernel
      modules.
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the screen to flicker.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-535 (535.98-0ubuntu1) mantic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that caused excessive memory consumption when
      OpenGL and Vulkan applications were running while VT-
      switched away from X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the kernel to panic when video
      memory is full.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented displays from refreshing when using
      an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)
      monitors to flicker by allowing the refresh rate to drop below
      the monitor's minimum.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption when running Vulkan
      applications.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a system hang when running
      windowed Vulkan applications with sync-to-vblank enabled.
    - Fixed a video memory leak observed when turning off a connected
      monitor while using certain Wayland compositors.
  * debian/rules:
    - Strip the binaries.
  * debian/template/control.in:
    - Introduce the new -core and -lrm meta-packages (LP: #2025538).
    - The nvidia-driver-$flavour package relies on DKMS, the
      nvidia-driver-lrm-$flavour is meant to be used with the
      linux-restricted module. They conflict with each other, and both
      depend on the nvidia-driver-core-$flavour meta-package.
  * debian/nvidia-driver-535.docs:
    - Rename to debian/nvidia-driver-core-535.docs.
