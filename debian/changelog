nvidia-graphics-drivers-535-server (535.104.05-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) focal; urgency=medium

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * New upstream release (LP: #2025243).
  * debian/rules{.defs}:
    - Adjust to the changes on the Nvidia servers.
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not start the systemd services on installation or upgrade, as this can
      lead to a black screen.

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add breaks&replaces on identical firmware files from other flavour.
      When 535 & 535-server driver versions happen to be at an identical
      upstream version, they both ship identical firmware files on disk at
      the same path. When a user attempts to install two drivers at the same
      time, this results in dpkg file conflict. Allow replacing one firmware
      with another (LP: #2026622).
