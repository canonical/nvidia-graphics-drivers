nvidia-graphics-drivers-535 (535.98-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that caused excessive memory consumption when
      OpenGL and Vulkan applications were running while VT-
      switched away from X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the kernel to panic when video
      memory is full.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented displays from refreshing when using
      an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)
      monitors to flicker by allowing the refresh rate to drop below
      the monitor's minimum.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption when running Vulkan
      applications.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a system hang when running
      windowed Vulkan applications with sync-to-vblank enabled.
    - Fixed a video memory leak observed when turning off a connected
      monitor while using certain Wayland compositors.
  * debian/rules:
    - Strip the binaries.
  * debian/template/control.in:
    - Introduce the new -core and -lrm meta-packages (LP: #2025538).
    - The nvidia-driver-$flavour package relies on DKMS, the
      nvidia-driver-lrm-$flavour is meant to be used with the
      linux-restricted module. They conflict with each other, and both
      depend on the nvidia-driver-core-$flavour meta-package.
  * debian/nvidia-driver-535.docs:
    - Rename to debian/nvidia-driver-core-535.docs.
