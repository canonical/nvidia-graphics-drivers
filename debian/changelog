nvidia-graphics-drivers-375 (375.82-0ubuntu0.16.04.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2017-6257, 2017-6259 (LP: #1709827).
  * New upstream release:
    - Fix a bug with GLX_EXT_buffer_age where incorrect buffer
      age values would be reported for SLI AFR configurations.
      In such configurations buffer age may now be greater than 3
      the previous maximum buffer age.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause hanging and Xids when performing
      RandR transforms with Overlay and SLI enabled.
    - Improved handling of framebuffer console restore on systems
      booted in UEFI mode.
    - Extended the information reported by the NVIDIA Xinerama X
      extension to report PRIME displays in addition to
      directly-connected displays.
    - Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio devices to appear or
      disappear inconsistently when HDMI devices were hotplugged or
      unplugged.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause driver errors when setting modes
      on X screens running at Depth 8 or Depth 15.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause intermittent kernel panics when
      running with PRIME Sync.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a kernel panic when hotplugging HDMI
      displays on some Zotac mini PCs.
    - Updated nvidia-installer to label kernel modules with SELinux
      file type 'modules_object_t'. Some system SELinux policies
      only permit loading of kernel modules with this SELinux file
      type.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-375 (375.66-0ubuntu0.16.04.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2017-0350, 2017-0351, 2017-0353 (LP: #1689336).
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
      o Quadro P3000
      o Quadro M520
      o TITAN Xp
    - Fixed a bug that could cause EGL applications to crash when
      calling eglInitialize() multiple times on X11-backed displays.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause rendering corruption on a
      monitor connected via DisplayPort upon a modeset event (for
      example, changing resolutions or power cycling the monitor).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to crash when
      VT switching between multiple X servers.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the system to become unresponsive after
      resuming from power management suspend/hibernate.  Additional
      symptoms of this bug included display flickering and "Xid 56"
      errors in the kernel log.
    - Fixed a bug that caused backlight brightness to not be
      controllable on some notebooks with DisplayPort internal
      panels.
    - Fixed a bug that left HDMI and DisplayPort audio muted after a
      framebuffer console mode was restored. For some displays, this
      caused the display to remain blank.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over DisplayPort to stop working
      when the monitor was unplugged and plugged back in or awoken
      from DPMS power-saving mode.
    - Restored support for the following GPU:
      GRID K520
    - Fixed a regression that caused corruption in certain
      applications, such as window border shadows in Unity, after
      resuming from suspend.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some applications to crash when
      running with PRIME Sync.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Sync from working on notebooks
      with GeForce GTX 4xx and 5xx series GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL apps to have excessive CPU usage
      when running with PRIME Sync but without native displays
      enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause PRIME Sync to deadlock in the
      kernel, particularly common on Linux 4.10.
    - Fixed a bug that caused PRIME Sync to run slowly on systems
      with Pascal GPUs.
