nvidia-graphics-drivers-535-server (535.104.12-0ubuntu1) mantic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #2037266):
    - Fixed an issue where the NVSwitch driver would not retrain
      NVLinks on init correctly on HGX 8 H100, in case they faulted
      earlier (such a due to GPU resets). This would result in links
      being down and CUDA workloads failing with "system not yet
      initialized" error. The issue was introduced in the 535.86.10
      driver and fixed in 535.104.12 and later drivers.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * New upstream release (LP: #2025243).
  * debian/rules{.defs}:
    - Adjust to the changes on the Nvidia servers.
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not start the systemd services on installation or upgrade, as this can
      lead to a black screen.

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add breaks&replaces on identical firmware files from other flavour.
      When 535 & 535-server driver versions happen to be at an identical
      upstream version, they both ship identical firmware files on disk at
      the same path. When a user attempts to install two drivers at the same
      time, this results in dpkg file conflict. Allow replacing one firmware
      with another (LP: #2026622).
