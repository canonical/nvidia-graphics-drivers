nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.41.19-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause 1
      second hangs when transitioning from blit-based display to
      overlay-based display. This would most commonly happen when
      disabling a compositing manager.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when capturing SDI video.
    - Fixed a corner-case in which the OpenGL driver could leak
      resources in applications utilizing fork().
    - Addressed a Linux kernel interface compatibility problem that
      could lead to ioremap() errors and, potentially, functional
      and/or stability problems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail on some
      Intel based systems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail when using
      recent Linux kernels, such as 2.6.38.
  * debian/dkms.conf{.in}:
    - Enable builds for 3.0 kernels.
  * debian/control{.in}:
    - Drop transitional packages.
  * Add buildfix_kernel_3.0.patch:
    - Add support for linux 3.0.
  * Drop obsolete patches:
    - drm_agp_memory-2.6.31.patch, fall_back_on_mtrr_if_no_pat.patch,
      nvidia-2.6.36-ioctl.patch, nvidia-rt-compat.patch,
      rt_preempt_31.patch, vga_arbiter_workaround.patch.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.41.06-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that caused some GPUs to stop responding when the X
      Server was started. All GPUs are susceptible, but the failure
      was primarily seen on GF104 and GF106 boards.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.41.03-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug causing the X server to hang every 49.7 days on
      32-bit platforms.
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GT 520
      o GeForce GT 525M
      o GeForce GT 520M
      o GeForce GT 445M
      o GeForce GT 530
      o GeForce 405
      o GeForce GTX 590
      o GeForce GTX 550 Ti
      o GeForce GT 420
      o GeForce GT 440
      o GeForce GTX 470M
      o GeForce GTX 485M
      o GeForce GT 550M
      o GeForce GT 555M
      o NVS 4200M
      o Quadro 1000M
      o Quadro 2000M
  * debian/dkms.conf{.in}:
    - Prevent builds with kernels newer than the ones we ship. This
      makes sense as we do not update drivers to add the support for
      kernels that are not in Ubuntu. This will reduce the amount of
      bug reports which are generated when DKMS fails to build modules
      for unsupported kernels.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.29-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added official support for xserver 1.10. The -ignoreABI option
      is no longer required with this version of the server.
    - Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero. A new NVIDIA kernel module
      option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations, allows administrators to
      revert to the previous behavior.
    - Added preliminary support for xserver 1.10.
    - Reorganized the NVIDIA driver's /proc file system layout to better
      reflect current needs: /proc/driver/nvidia/cards/0..N has been
      moved to /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information
    - Added new shared library: libnvidia-ml.so.
    - NVML provides programmatic access to static information and monitoring
      data for NVIDIA GPUs, as well as limited managment capabilities. It is 
      intended for use with Tesla compute products. See web-based
      documentation and associated nvml.h header for more info.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionDisplayType" to specify
      the display type when NVIDIA 3D Vision is enabled with a non
      3D Vision ready display.
    - Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.
    - Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank. This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate. This behavior can be controlled by a new
      NV-CONTROL attribute, NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES. By default, LUT updates
      are not synchronized. This may cause flickering in some applications that
      use the colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8
      X screen. If you experience flickering, try running:
      nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 560 Ti
    - Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY status
      changes.
    - Added a new X configuration option "Interactive", which defaults to enabled,
      but can be disabled to allow long-running GPU compute programs to run
      concurrently with X.
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause VDPAU "display
      preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or pixmaps.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation queue
      following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its VDPAU
      presentation queue.
  * debian/control{.in}:
    - Depend on ${xinpdriver:Depends} (LP: #616214).
  * debian/nvidia-current.postrm{.in}:
    - Make sure that the driver's directory is removed (LP: #540143).
  * debian/nvidia-current.links{32}{.in}:
    - Add links to libnvcuvid*.so* and to libnvidia-ml*.so* for both 32bit
      and 64bit (LP: #704607).
  * debian/rules:
    - Add libnvcuvid*.so*, libnvidia-ml*.so* and libXvMCNVIDIA*.so.* to the
      32bit compatibility libraries.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.29-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 460 SE
      o GeForce GTX 570
      o Quadro 5000M
      o NVS 300
    - Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become unresponsive
      for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing the resolution or refresh
      rate.
    - Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
    - See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README for further
      details.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionProConfigFile" to allow user
      provide a filename which NVIDIA X driver uses to store 3D Vision Pro
      configuration settings. See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README
      for more information.
  * debian/control{.in}:
    - Replace "NVIDIA 8" with "GeForce 8" in the description
     (LP: #639976). Thanks to Gaurav Aggarwal for the patch.
  * Add support for blacklisting card ids from GRUB gfxpayload=keep:
    - In Natty gfxpayload=keep is set by default so as to provide a framebuffer
      early in the boot process. Some cards don't play nicely with it, therefore
      we need to blacklist them in a file. The format is a sequence of lines of
      the following form:
        vVENDORdDEVICEsvSUBVENDORsdSUBDEVICEbcBASECLASSscSUBCLASS
      Blacklist lines are regex-matched against a corresponding PCI ID string.
      In practice this means that you can replace any part of the ID string
      with .* to match anything.

    - debian/control.in: Add XB-Modaliases header and dh-modaliases build
      dependency.
    - debian/rules: Build the modalias list to
      debian/nvidia-current.modaliases, where dh_modaliases picks it up, and

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a race condition in OpenGL that could cause crashes with
      multithreaded applications.
    - Fixed a bug that may cause OpenGL applications which fork to
      crash.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused it to attempt allocation of
      huge blocks of system memory. This regression was introduced
      in the 260.* driver series.
  * debian/dkms.conf.in:
    - Apply nvidia-2.6.36-ioctl.patch when dealing with 2.6.37
      kernels too.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.06-0ubuntu1) maverick; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server
      behavior that caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver
      1.9 (LP: #629910).
    - Enhanced VDPAU to support interop with CUDA and OpenGL
      when Xinerama is active.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial
      de-interlacing from operating when temporal de-interlacing
      was not also enabled.
    - Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when
      driving a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro
      4600/5600 or newer GPU. See the "Dithering Controls" in the
      Flat Panel page in nvidia-settings.
  * debian/headers, nvidia-current-dev.install{.in}:
   - Put the headers from 256.53 in debian/headers and install
     them in nvidia-current-dev as usual. Starting from the 260
     series, these headers are no longer distributed with the
     Nvidia installer. In Natty we'll package them separately
     but for now we'll keep them in nvidia-current-dev.
  * debian/dkms/patches/nvidia-2.6.36-ioctl.patch:

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that prevented XvMC from initializing in most
      cases.
    - Added support for xorg-server video driver ABI version 8,
      which will be included in the xorg-server-1.9 series of
      releases (LP: #616023).
    - Fixed a bug that caused extremely slow rendering of OpenGL
      applications on X screens other than screen 0 when using a
      compositing manager.
    - Fixed a regression introduced after 256.35 that caused
      stability problems on GPUs such as GeForce GT 240.
    - Fixed a slow kernel virtual address space leak observed
      when starting and stopping OpenGL, CUDA, or VDPAU
      applications.
    - Fixed a bug that left the system susceptible to hangs
      when running two or more VDPAU applications simultaneously.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (256.44-0ubuntu1) maverick; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Switch to new xsfbs variables to get the xserver ABI
      (LP: #616214).
  * debian/nvidia-current.dirs.in:
    - Remove duplicate line. 
  * New upstream release:
    - Added Support for GeForce GTX 460.
    - Added Support for Quadro 4000, Quadro 5000, and Quadro 6000.
    - Fixed VDPAU to not print a debug error message when calling
      VdpVideoMixerQueryFeatureSupport with an unsupported or
      unknown VdpVideoMixerFeature.
    - Removed the requirement that in TwinView passive stereo,
      MetaModes must have identical viewports on each monitor.
    - Removed the requirement that in active stereo, all monitors
      must use identical modetimings.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to better report certain kinds of
      initialization error.
    - Fixed a regression that caused Xv to return BadAlloc errors
      on AGP systems when using the AGP GART driver contained in
      the NVIDIA driver.This fixes the problem reported in
      nvnews.net thread 151199.
   * This release still doesn't report to be compatible with the
     new xserver ABI but works fine if the ignoreABI option is
     set in xorg.conf.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/nvidia-current-dev*:
    - Make the dev package conflict with other dev packages which
      provide nvidia-dev so as to make it possible to install
      headers directly in /usr/include.
  * Adapt the packaging scripts to the new NVIDIA installers.
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a 3D Vision Stereo bug that caused the stereo glasses
      to not toggle when the flat panel was not running at its
      native mode timings.
    - Fixed a bug which prevented use of high performance PowerMizer
      levels on systems with certain ACPI configurations.
    - Fixed a bug that caused non-primary Fermi GPUs to fail to
      initialize framebuffer memory. This caused a variety of
      symptoms, up to and including system hangs.
    - Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      o GL_ARB_blend_func_extended
      o GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend
      o GL_ARB_sample_shading
      o GL_ARB_timer_query
      o GL_EXT_draw_buffers2
      o GL_EXT_separate_shader_objects
      o GL_NV_explicit_multisample
      o GL_NV_transform_feedback
    - Fixed an interaction problem between Compiz and
      'screen-scraping' VNC servers like x11vnc and vino that
      caused the screen to stop updating (LP: #353126).
    - Enhanced VDPAU to add basic support for Xinerama. VDPAU will
      now operate on a single physical X screen under Xinerama.
      See the README for more details.
    - Enhanced VDPAU's handling of corrupt clips of all formats
      on GPUs with VDPAU feature set C to be at least as good as
      on GPUs with VDPAU feature set B. This significantly
      improves various clips provided by nvnews.net user eamiller.
    - Fixed a bug in Xv attribute handling that caused hue,
      saturation, brightness and contrast values to be misapplied
      when using an Xv overlay adaptor.
    - Fixed a bug in the XvMC driver that prevented it from
      working on systems with AGP graphics cards.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to clear all VdpVideoSurfaces to black when
      allocated. This provides more consistent results when using
      a surface as a reference when no prior decode operation has
      written to that surface. In turn, this improves the results
      of decoding some corrupt streams, such as "p_only_no_play"
      from ffmpeg bug 1124.
    - Implemented new APIs to allow sharing VDPAU surfaces with
      OpenGL andCUDA. The OpenGL extension is GL_NV_vdpau_interop.
      For CUDA, please see the documentation in the CUDA toolkit
      for details.
    - Worked around a bug where the combination of a GPU with
      VDPAU feature set A together with specific motherboard
      chipsets could cause visible corruption when decoding some
      MPEG-2 streams.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the VDPAU overlay-based
      presentation queue from being used more than a few hundred
      times per X server invocation.
    - Renamed the driver file libGLcore.so.VERSION to
      libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION, as a small step towards
      reducing the filename collisions between NVIDIA's and
      MESA's OpenGL implementations.This driver file is used by
      NVIDIA's libGL.so and libglx.so, and should never be used
      directly by applications.
    - Changed the SONAME of libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION,
      libnvidia-tls.so.VERSION, and libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION
      to be ".so.VERSION", rather than ".so.1". These driver files
      are only used by other NVIDIA driver components, and are
      only intended to be usedby components of the matching NVIDIA
      driver version.
    - Removed the "-pkg#" suffix from the NVIDIA Linux .run files.
      The packages are now simply named "NVIDIA-Linux-ARCH-VERSION.run".
      On Linux-x86_64, a package which omits the 32-bit compatibility
      libraries is also available:
      "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-VERSION-no-compat32.run"
    - Compressed the nvidia-settings, nvidia-installer and
      nvidia-xconfig tarballs with bzip2, rather than gzip.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * debian/nvidia_supported:
    - nVidia changed the driver blob so that the old heuristic for finding the
      symbol with the PCI ID list failed. Implement a new heuristic by finding
      the symbol that matches the ID list in README closely enough. (README is
      missing a great number of IDs, which is why we need to grab the list
      from the blob in the first place).

  * Rework packaging taking Mandriva's as a model:
    - Use alternatives instead of diversions.
    - Reduce the number of binary packages to nvidia-current,
      nvidia-current-dev and nvidia-current-modaliases.
  * debian/rules:
    - Switch to CDBS.
    - Remove libGL.la as no static library is provided.
  * debian/nvidia-current.README.Debian.in:
    - Document the update process.
  * nvidia-current.postinst: try to build the module for the most
    recent kernel in addition to building it for the current kernel
    (LP: #474917).
  * New upstream release (LP: #494166):
   - Add support for xserver 1.7.x.
   - Added support for the following GPUs:
     o GeForce G102M
     o GeForce GT 220
     o GeForce G210
     o GeForce G210M
     o GeForce GT 230M
     o GeForce GT 240M
     o GeForce GTS 250M
     o GeForce GTS 260M 
   - Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings disclaimer window for the GPU
     Clock Frequencies Coolbits page, such that the "Accept" button is
     selectable when the desktop is so tall that the entire disclaimer
     can be viewed without scrolling.
   - Fixed a recent regression that caused the Xinerama option to not
     be set properly in the X configuration file when saving and
     merging from the nvidia-settings X Server Display Configuration
     page.
   - Fixed a resource leak in VDPAU's blit-based presentation queue.
     This bug limited the number of presentation queue objects that
     could be created and destroyed in a single application instance,
     and hence could limit the number of streams that could be
     displayed and/or the number of iterations of "loop" playback.
   - Fixed a power management regression that prevented some notebooks
     and systems with integrated GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs from
     suspending.
   - Fixed a regression that caused TV-OUT controls to be unavailable
     on some GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.
   - Updated the NVIDIA X driver to allow, on GeForce 8 or greater
     GPUs, more modes to validate on digital display devices whose
     EDIDs report very constrained HorizSync or VertRefresh ranges.
   - Fixed a randomly occuring X server crash caused by the PixmapCache
     option.
   - Increased the allowed amount of overscan compensation from 100 to
     200.
   - On GPUs with VDPAU feature set B, VDPAU's handling of some
     corrupted or incorrectly formatted H.264 and MPEG streams has
     been improved.
   - Fixed a memory allocation problem with pre-GeForce 8 GPUs that
     caused GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap clients (e.g., Compiz, KDE 4)
     to display incorrect contents.
   - Modified the installation location and names of internal VDPAU
     libraries to conform to conventions and Debian packaging guidelines.
     New versions of libvdpau expect this layout. Compatibility with old
     versions of libvdpau is maintained with symlinks.
   - Fixed a bug that could cause errors in graphical applications run
     after a previous application using VDPAU and OpenGL. This behaviour
     was observed when running Gwenole Beauchesne's hwdecode-demos
     application.
   - Modified vdpau.h to increment VDPAU_VERSION, to reflect the fact that
     new features have been added in the past. Also, add the new define
     VDPAU_INTERFACE_VERSION.
   - Fixed a periodic temporary hang in the VDPAU blit-based presentation
     queue.
   - Fixed a problem that caused resolution limitations or corruption on
     certain DisplayPort devices such as the Apple 24" Cinema display or
     some DisplayPort to VGA adapters.
   - Disabled the UseEvents option for GeForce 8 series and higher GPUs
     due to a problem that causes occasional short hangs. It will be
     re-enabled when that bug has been tracked down and fixed.
   - VDPAU now allows multiple streams to be decoded at once, without the
     need to set any environment variables.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-180 (185.18.36-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #408561)
    - Fixed a bug that caused kernel panics when starting X on some mobile GPUs
    - Fixed an interaction problem between VDPAU and PowerMizer when using
      VDPAU solely as a display mechanism, and not to decode video streams. The 
      GPU performance level should now be raised, if required, in this scenario.
    - Fixed VDPAU to avoid "display preemption" in some cases where a 
      VdpOutputSurface is deleted while it is still active (either queued or
      visible) in a VdpPresentationQueue. In particular, this can occur in 
      MPlayer when using the "-fs" option, and could completely prevent VDPAU 
      from operating successfully, depending on the exact timing conditions.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-180 (185.18.31-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Rename package as -185 and make -180 a transitional package.
  * Drop drm_agp_memory-2.6.31.patch as the module builds with 2.6.31
    kernels now.
  * New upstream release:
    -Fixed a crash on certain mobile GPUs.
    -Added code to forcibly terminate long-running CUDA kernels when Ctrl-C
     is pressed.
    -Fixed a bug that could cause occasional memory corruption problems or
     segmentation faults when running OpenGL applications on Quadro GPUs.
    -Fixed a deadlock in the OpenGL library that could be triggered in certain
     rare circumstances on Quadro GPUs.
    -Fixed an interaction problem between PowerMizer and CUDA applications 
     that caused the performance level to be reduced while the CUDA kernel is
     running.
    -Made CUDA compute-exclusive mode persistent across GPU resets.
    -Fixed the order of outputs in the GPUScaling nvidia-settings property.
    -Fixed a bug that caused graphics corruption in some OpenGL applications
     when the Unified Back Buffer is enabled the application window is moved.
    -Fixed a bug that caused glXGetVideoSyncSGI, glXWaitVideoSyncSGI, and 
     glXGetRefreshRateSGI to operate on the wrong screen when there are 
     multiple X screens.
    -Fixed a bug that causes corruption or GPU errors when an application 
     paints a redirected window whose background is set to ParentRelative on
     X.Org servers older than 1.5. This was typically triggered by running
     Kopete while using Compiz or Beryl.
    -Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption when decoding
     H.264 clips with alternating frame/field coded reference pictures, and a
     video surface is concurrently removed from the DPB, and re-used as the 
     decode target, in a single decode operation. This affected all GPUs 
     supported by VDPAU.
    -Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
     edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 advanced profile clips whose 
     heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on G98 and MCP7x (IGP) GPUs.
    -Enhanced VDPAU to better handle corrupt/invalid H.264 bitstreams on G84,
     G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs. This should prevent most cases of 
     "display preemption" that are caused by bitstream errors.
    -Fixed an X server crash when using the VDPAU overlay-based presentation 
     queue and VT-switching away from the X server.
    -Enhanced VDPAU's detection of the GPU's video decode capabilities.
    -Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause ghosting/flashing issues when 
     decoding H.264 clips, in certain full DPB scenarios, on G98 and MCP7x.
    -Fixed VDPAU to detect an attempt to destroy the VdpDevice object when 
     other device-owned objects still exist. VDPAU now triggers 
     "display preemption", and returns an error, when this occurs.
    -Enhanced VDPAU's error handling and resource management in presentation
     queue creation and operation. This change correctly propagates all errors
     back to the client application, and avoids some resource leaks.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-180 (185.18.14-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #376067):
    - Fixed a Xinerama drawable resource management problem that can 
      cause GLXBadDrawable errors in certain cases, such as when Wine
      applications are run.
      (LP: #344721)
    - Fixed XineramaQueryScreens to return 0 screens instead of 1 
      screen with the geometry of screen 0 when XineramaIsActive 
      returns false. This conforms to the Xinerama manual page and 
      fixes an interaction problem with Compiz when there is more 
      than one X screen.
    - Moved kernel module loading earlier in the X driver's 
      initialization, to facilitate more graceful fallbacks if the 
      kernel module cannot be loaded. Removed the LoadKernelModule X 
      configuration option.
    - Added support for new horizontal interlaced and checkerboard 
      passive stereo modes.
    - Fixed an OpenGL driver crash while running Bibble 5.
    - Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management 
      suspend/resume events.
    - Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance 
      problems when a composite manager is running.
      (LP: 294925)
    - Fixed a bug with VT-switching or mode-switching while using 
      Compiz; the bug could lead to a corrupted desktop (e.g., a 
      white screen) or in the worst case an X server crash.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause GPU errors in some cases while 
      driving Quadro SDI products.
    - Fixed a several second hang when VT-switching while OpenGL 
      stereo applications were running on pre-G80 Quadro GPUs.
    - Added support for multiple swap group members on G80 and later 
      Quadro GPUs.
    - Fixed the behavior of the NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_DELAY 
      NV-CONTROL attribute on Quadro G-Sync II.
    - Fixed a problem with Quadro SDI where transitioning from 
      "clone mode" to "OpenGL mode" would fail.
    - Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of corruption when decoding 
      H.264 video containing field-coded reference frames on G84, G86, 
      G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs. Such streams are commonly found in 
      DVB broadcasts.
    - Slightly improved the performance of the VDPAU noise reduction 
      algorithm.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to validate whether overlay usage is supported by 
      the current hardware configuration, and to automatically fall 
      back to the blit-based presentation queue if required.
    - Fixed error checking in VdpVideoMixerRender, to reject calls 
      that specify more layers than the VdpMixer was created with.
    - Modified VDPAU's VDPAU_DEBUG code to emit a complete backtrace 
      on all platforms, not just on 32-bit Linux.
    - Improved interaction between VDPAU and PowerMizer; appropriate 
      performance levels should now be chosen for video playback of all 
      standard resolutions on all supported GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that sometimes caused "display preemption" 
      when the VdpDecoderCreate function failed.
    - Fixed a potential segfault in the VDPAU trace library, triggered 
      by a multi-threaded application creating a new VdpDevice in one 
      thread, at the same time that another thread detected "display 
      preemption".
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - OpenOffice and Skype no longer have flickering buttons on mouseover
      when compiz is enabled. (LP: #286932)

nvidia-graphics-drivers-180 (180.44-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #348852).
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o Quadro FX 3800
      o Quadro FX 1800
      o Quadro FX 580
      o Quadro FX 380
      o Quadro NVS 295
      o GeForce GT 120
      o GeForce G100
    - Fixed a problem that could cause Xid errors and display corruption
      in certain cases when OpenGL is used to render to redirected windows,
      for example when Java2D is used with the -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true option.
    - Updated glGetStringi(GL_EXTENSIONS, i) to no longer return NULL in 
      OpenGL 3.0 preview contexts.
    - Fixed OpenGL crashes while running KDE4's Plasma.
    - Fixed OpenGL crashes when using a large number of texture objects.
    - Fixed the timestamp reporting in the GL_NV_present_video extension
      on SDI II with Quadro FX 4800 and 5800.
    - Improved power management support on some systems, such as 
      Hewlett-Packard xw4600 workstations.
    - Fixed a problem that caused the screen to flicker momentarily when
      OpenGL applications exit unexpectedly on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.
    - Fixed an X server crash when an X client attempts to draw trapezoids
      and RenderAccel is disabled.
    - Improved recovery from certain types of errors.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Autodesk Maya to freeze when overlays are 
      enabled.
    - Fixed an interaction problem between OpenGL and memory tracking
      libraries such as MicroQuill SmartHeap.
    - Added support for RG renderbuffers in OpenGL 3.0.

      by VDPAU; see the README for details.
    - Fixed VDPAU corruption on some H.264 clips.
    - Updated VDPAU documentation in the README and in vdpau.h, in 
      particular regarding how to use the deinterlacing algorithms in the
      VdpVideoMixer object. Explicitly documented "half rate" deinterlacing,
      which should allow the advanced algorithms to run on more low-end
      systems.
    - Implemented a "skip chroma deinterlace" option in VDPAU, which should
      allow the advanced deinterlacing algorithms to run on more low-end
      systems. See vdpau.h.
    - Fixed VDPAU VC-1 decoding on 64-bit platforms.
    - Updated the VDPAU wrapper library to print dlerror() messages when
      driver loading problems occur.
    - Improved VDPAU's handling of some corrupt H.264 streams, and some
      corrupt/invalid MPEG streams on some GPUs.
    - Fixed VDPAU to correctly handle WMV "range reduction" on some GPUs.
      A minor backwards-compatible API change was made for this; see
      vdpau.h's documentation for structure field VdpPictureInfoVC1.rangered.
    - Fixed a problem that caused surfaces to be marked as visible too early
      when the blit presentation queue is in use.
    - Fixed VDPAU to prevent some cases of "display preemption" in the face
      of missing H.264 reference frames on some GPUs.
    - Fixed corruption decoding H.264 clips with pictures where 
      pic_order_cnt_type implies log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 is not
      used, on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, GT200 GPUs.
    - Update vdpau.h to document exact requirements for VdpDecoderRender
      bitstream data content.
