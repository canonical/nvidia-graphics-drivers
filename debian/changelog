    - Fixed a bug that caused excessive memory consumption when
      OpenGL and Vulkan applications were running while VT-
      switched away from X.

      memory is full.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented displays from refreshing when using
      an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink.

      monitors to flicker by allowing the refresh rate to drop below
      the monitor's minimum.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption when running Vulkan
      applications.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a system hang when running
      windowed Vulkan applications with sync-to-vblank enabled.
