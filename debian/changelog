nvidia-graphics-drivers-510-server (510.73.08-0ubuntu1) kinetic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #1975509):
    - When calculating the address of grid barrier allocated for a CUDA stream,
      there was an off-by-one error. The address calculation is corrected in this
      release.
    - An issue that caused an AC cycle test to fail with "AssertionError: NVLink links
      with inappropriate status found" is resolved.
    - An issue that caused NX 11 to become nonresponsive during a graphics operation
      is resolved.
    - Linking issues were observed when using libnvfm.so. Now and other depend tools
      use dynamic linking with libstdc++ and libgcc.
    - An intermittent error CUDA_ERROR_NVLINK_UNCORRECTABLE caused by some
      non-fatal nvlink interrupts is resolved.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Drop the unused generate-nvidia-icd-json target.

  [ Jeremy Szu ]
  * Fix regex in modalias addition, since it does not work
    in dash (LP: #1964756)

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * debian/rules, debian/rules.defs:
    - Drop remove-stack-markings.
  * templates: encode amd64-only libraries and binaries
    - Improve unpacking logic.
    - Enable arm64 builds
    - Drop unused autogen target.
    - Drop unused AUTOCLEAN.
    - Drop call to AUTOKEEP.
    - Fix clean target. After ./debian/rules unpack-stamp;
      calling ./debian/rules clean did not clean correct
      symlinks. It looks like unpackging has moved from an
      $arch/ subdir, to the package top-level, whilst
      dh_auto_clean was not adjusted.

    debian/templates/nvidia-kernel-common-flavour.install.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-kernel-common-flavour.install.in:
    - Encode amd64-only libraries and binaries. Some libraries
      and binaries are amd64-only, mark them as such, instead
      of i386_excluded.
