nvidia-graphics-drivers-510-server (510.73.08-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) focal; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #1975509):
    - When calculating the address of grid barrier allocated for a CUDA stream,
      there was an off-by-one error. The address calculation is corrected in this
      release.
    - An issue that caused an AC cycle test to fail with "AssertionError: NVLink links
      with inappropriate status found" is resolved.
    - An issue that caused NX 11 to become nonresponsive during a graphics operation
      is resolved.
    - Linking issues were observed when using libnvfm.so. Now and other depend tools
      use dynamic linking with libstdc++ and libgcc.
    - An intermittent error CUDA_ERROR_NVLINK_UNCORRECTABLE caused by some
      non-fatal nvlink interrupts is resolved.
